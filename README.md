# Exploring-and-Visualizing-a-Simple-Dataset

Introduction:
             The Iris Dataset is one of the most famous and widely used datasets in the field of data science and machine learning. It contains measurements of four features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width — for three species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The dataset is often used as a beginner’s dataset for classification and data visualization tasks because it is simple, clean, and well-structured.

Problem Statement:
                  The goal of this task is to explore and visualize the Iris Dataset to gain an understanding of its structure and the relationships between its features. By summarizing the data and creating visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots, we aim to:
1.Understand the distribution of each feature.
2.Identify possible patterns or relationships between different features.
3.Detect potential outliers or unusual values.
4.Develop insights that can help in further analysis, such as building classification models.

This exploration will help build foundational skills in working with datasets using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
